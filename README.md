# Flames Test Implementation

## Overview
Welcome to the Flames Test Implementation repository, a popular game that determines the relationship between two people based on their names. This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code.

## How the Flames Test Works
The Flames test is a simple algorithm that calculates the relationship between two people based on the letters in their names. The acronym FLAMES stands for:
- **F** - Friendship
- **L** - Love
- **A** - Affection
- **M** - Marriage
- **E** - Enmity
- **S** - Siblings
The algorithm works by removing common letters in the names of the two individuals, counting the remaining letters, and then cycling through the FLAMES acronym to determine the relationship.
